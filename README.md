# EmblaCoreJS

EmblaCoreJS is a TypeScript/JavaScript library containing the core session functionality in [Embla](https://github.com/mideind/EmblaFlutterApp), a cross-platform mobile Icelandic-language voice assistant client. EmblaCoreJS is packaged both for modern browser and React Native environments.

For the Dart/Flutter library see [EmblaCoreFlutter](https://github.com/mideind/EmblaCoreFlutter).

## Browser usage

The bundled web version of EmblaCoreJS, along with a minified version, can be found in the releases.
See the [browser example](./example/web/README.md) for example usage.

> **Important note:**
>
> Using the library requires an API key for the Ratatoskur server instance you wish to communicate with.
> To prevent the Ratatoskur API key from being sent to clients, it is recommended you set up an API endpoint which
> proxies the Ratatoskur authentication token endpoint. See endpoint documentation [here](https://api.greynir.is/docs).

### Installation

Use npm or yarn to install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
# Needed for web version
npm install recordrtc
# Needed for React Native version
npm install react-native-sound-player @dr.pogodin/react-native-audio
```

To build the project run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This compiles the code into JavaScript libraries found in `lib/web/` and `lib/react-native`.

## Documentation

Documentation can be generated by running:

```sh
npm run docs
```

Documentation is then found in `docs/` (open `docs/index.html` in a browser).

## Testing

Tests can be run with:

```bash
yarn run test
```

## Example usage

Examples can be found in the directories `example/web` and `example/react-native`.

Information on running them is found in the corresponding `README.md` files.
