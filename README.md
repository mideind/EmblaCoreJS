# EmblaCoreJS

EmblaCoreJS is a TypeScript/JavaScript library containing the core session functionality in [Embla](https://github.com/mideind/EmblaFlutterApp), a cross-platform mobile Icelandic-language voice assistant client.

For the Dart/Flutter library see [EmblaCoreFlutter](https://github.com/mideind/EmblaCoreFlutter).

## Local Installation

Use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to install dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
```

To build the project run:

```bash
yarn run build
```

This compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript libraries found in `lib/`, named `lib/emblacore.js` and `lib/emblacore.min.js`.

## Documentation

Documentation can be generated by running:

```bash
yarn run doc
```

## Testing

Tests can be run with:

```bash
yarn run test
```

The HTML files can then be found in the `lib/doc/` directory.

## Example

Example usages can be found in the `examples/` directory (currently only contains an example of usage in a browser environment).

### Browser example

To test the library in a browser environment navigate to the `examples/browser/` directory and run the following command (requires Python 3):

```bash
python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1 8000
```

Open the following URL in the browser: [`http://localhost:8000/client.html`](http://localhost:8000/client.html).
Note that running the example may require an API key for the server EmblaCoreJS is configured to communicate with.
